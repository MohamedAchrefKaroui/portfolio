## Project 2: Meteorite Landings Visualization and Prediction

- **Description**: In this project, I explored a dataset containing information about meteorite landings worldwide. I performed data visualization to gain insights into the distribution of meteorite landings across the globe. Additionally, I developed a predictive model to estimate the potential landing locations of meteorites based on various features.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn, machine learning, geospatial data analysis.
- **Key Achievements**: 
  - Created interactive visualizations of meteorite landing locations using maps and graphs.
  - Developed a machine learning model to predict potential landing locations.

## Project 3: Number of Deaths by Age Group
Description: In this project, I analyzed a dataset containing information about the number of deaths in different age groups. I created a bar chart to visualize the number of deaths in three categories: Firearm Deaths, Alcohol-Related Deaths, and Suicide Deaths.
Technologies Used: Python, Pandas, Plotly, Numpy, Seaborn.
Key Achievements:
- Visualized the number of deaths in different age groups using a bar chart.
- Compared the number of deaths across three categories.

## Project 4: Sign Language Hands Classification using CNN
Description: In this project, I tackled the task of classifying different sign language hand gestures using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). I worked with a dataset of images featuring various sign gestures and aimed to build a model capable of accurately identifying and classifying these gestures.
Technologies Used: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, CNN, image classification, data augmentation.
Key Achievements:
Developed a CNN architecture optimized for sign language gesture classification.
Implemented data augmentation techniques to improve model generalization.
Achieved a classification accuracy of 99% on a held-out test set.

## Project 5: Sentiment Analysis using Bag of words approach and roBERTa
Description: The Sentiment Analysis project focuses on analyzing textual data to determine the sentiment expressed in user reviews. Leveraging both traditional Bag of Words (BoW) approach and advanced RoBERTa-based models, the project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of sentiment in diverse textual data. The Bag of Words method involves representing text as an unordered set of words, capturing the frequency of each word to create a feature vector. On the other hand, RoBERTa, a state-of-the-art transformer-based model, employs contextualized embeddings to capture intricate language nuances, enhancing sentiment analysis accuracy.
Key Achievements:

Hybrid Sentiment Analysis Approach: Successfully implemented a hybrid approach that combines the simplicity of Bag of Words with the advanced capabilities of RoBERTa for sentiment analysis.

Feature Engineering with Bag of Words: Applied Bag of Words feature engineering to convert textual data into numerical vectors, capturing word frequencies to represent sentiment in a traditional manner.

Integration of RoBERTa: Integrated RoBERTa, a transformer-based model, to leverage contextualized embeddings and enhance sentiment analysis accuracy by capturing complex language patterns and relationships.

Data Preprocessing and Tokenization: Implemented robust NLP techniques for data preprocessing, including text cleaning, tokenization, and feature extraction, ensuring the models receive quality input.
